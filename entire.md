# Backup and restore the entire ICP environment

As described in the introduction, we don't recommend using a traditional server backup to persist an ICP environment (because of etcd).

However, a full environment backup might be required to quickly restore the environment to its initial state, then apply specific component restore, as documented at [Backup and restore ICP components](components.md)

We are using here that an ICP environment has already been deployed.
